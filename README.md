# mandelwhat

A basic Clojure implementation of an ASCII Mandelbrot fractal generator.  It
would probably be really cool to print out a massive version of this and hang
it on the wall if I had some free time.

## Usage

```sh
> lein repl

user=> (use 'mandelwhat.core)
user=> (show-mandelbrot (mandelbrot-test))
```
